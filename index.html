<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is promoting Open Source software in the Netherlands by organizing events and activities around these technologies. </p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Dutch Cloud Native community began taking shape with the first meetup in 2016 and has grown steadily over the years into a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem. Through the dedication of many volunteers, organizers, and supporters, the community has hosted numerous monthly meetups and organized three successful Kubernetes Community Day (KCD) events.
In recognition of this momentum and to support sustainable, vendor-neutral growth, Stichting Cloud Native Netherlands was officially founded on 24 December 2024. The foundation provides structure and continuity to the community’s ongoing activities.
Today, the community includes more than 4,000 members, and continues to grow thanks to the collaborative efforts of individuals and organizations who share a passion for open source, cloud-native technologies, and knowledge sharing.
<h2 id="cncf-collab">CNCF collab</h2>
<p>We collaborate closely with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the global organization dedicated to bringing together the world’s top developers, end users, and vendors and run the largest open source developer conferences. </p>
<p>Many of the foundation members are CNCF ambassadors or cover other roles in the Kubernetes and Cloud Native community ecosystem at large.</p>
